"`backend_argument` value(s) for `url` when configuring memcache did not "
"properly handle multiple servers. This is because the URL was passed as a "
"string (comma delimited) instead of a list to the memcache library/client. "
"The `url` argument is now special cased and will split the string on a comma "
"so that it mirrors the behavior of the ListOpt used by `memcache_servers` "

"[`bug 1819957 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1819957>`_] If a "
"memcache server disappears and then reconnects when multiple memcache "
"servers are used (specific to the python-memcached based backends) it is "
"possible that the server will contain stale data. The default is now to "
"supply the ``flush_on_reconnect`` optional argument to the backend. This "
"means that when the service connects to a memcache server, it will flush all "
"cached data in the server. This change only impacts the pooled backend as it "
"is the most likely (with heavy use of greenlet) to be impacted by the "
"problem and is the recommended production configuration."
